- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight interactive elements and important insights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, professional appearance. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability.
- Use a set of consistent and professional icons, such as Material Design icons, throughout the dashboard to represent different functions and data points.

- Implement subtle animations for user interactions, such as highlighting on hover, progress bar updates, and side panel transitions. The goal is to improve usability without being distracting.
